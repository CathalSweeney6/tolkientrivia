# Tolkien Trivia 
 'Tolkien Trivia' is a quiz website that's questions are focused on the mythos and lore of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth

The site is a fun, interactive experience, that is very easy to navigate through. It consists of three pages, the 'Welcome page' page, the 'Quiz' page, and a 'Bonus Prize' page at the end of the quiz.

## Inception and Initial Design

I wanted the aesthetic of the website to match that of 'The Lord of the Rings' move franchise. I began by creating a mock-up design using Balsamiq Wireframes. I am very happy with the final result, as the original mockup  translated very well onto the final project.

 I created the quiz's logo by downloading the 'Ringbearer' font from dafont.com. This font is a based off of the original font used in the trilogy's movie posters. I formatted the logo in Adobe Photoshop, where I embossed and added an outline and shadow to  the final logo.

## Features

### Interactive Home Page
* The Home Page welcomes the user to the quiz site. 
* It features an '<i>' tag that loads the href to the quizgame.html page.
* The tag is styled using a ring icon, similar in appearance to the One Ring from the books and films. 
* The icon was taken from [fontawesome.com](https://fontawesome.com/icons).
* I was able to animate the icon on fontawesome.com, to make it fade in and out of opacity and pulsate, an ode to the mystical nature of the One Ring.

### Background Image

* The background image was taken from [wallpaperaccess.com](https://wallpaperaccess.com/red-leather), a site where you can download royalty-free background images. I wanted to go for a cracked red leather background, similar to that of Bilbo's Journal.
* The orignal background that I found was too bright and garish. I loaded the background into Adobe Photoshop and toned it down, using the burn tool.

### Our Bakes 

* The second page of the website features six of the most popular bakes by the Bakery. 
* Each bakes are aligned in opposite directions, per-row, along with a short descriptive paragraph in their box divs.
* The designed box divs are based off the company logo, with the RGB charcoal and orange colors, taken from the logo, using an eyedropper tool.

## Colour Scheme and Design 

The colour scheme of the website, was based off the colours that feature in the company's logo. Using [imagecolorpicker.com](https://imagecolorpicker.com), I was able to isolate and identify the RGB values for the different colours that I wanted to use for the website. See the RBG colour palette, below the company logo, created using [coolors.com](https://coolors.com).

The site appeared clear, was easy to use and was legible on all screen sizes. 

The link to Instagram works.

I also tested the performance of the website on Google Lighthouse, on Dev-tools. Below is my site's score.
