# Tolkien Trivia 
 'Tolkien Trivia' is a quiz website that's questions are focused on the mythos and lore of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth

The site is a fun, interactive experience, that is very easy to navigate through. It consists of three pages, the 'Welcome page' page, the 'Quiz' page, and a 'Bonus Prize' page at the end of the quiz.

## Inception and Initial Design

I wanted the aesthetic of the website to match that of 'The Lord of the Rings' move franchise. I began by creating a mock-up design using Balsamiq Wireframes. I am very happy with the final result, as the original mockup  translated very well onto the final project.

 I created the quiz's logo by downloading the 'Ringbearer' font from dafont.com. This font is a based off of the original font used in the trilogy's movie posters. I formatted the logo in Adobe Photoshop, where I embossed and added an outline and shadow to  the final logo. 

 Original logo.

## Features

* Navigation and Ease of Access

### Hamburger Menu
* I placed a dropdown hamburger menu at the top-right corner of the website. 
* The menu navigates the user through to the 'Home,' 'Our Bakes,' and "Contact Us' pages. 
* The menu sections are decorated with icons from [fontawesome.com](https://fontawesome.com/icons).

### Header 

* The header features the Bakery's logo, along with their tagline 'The Artisan Way, Since 2021.'
* The tagline and other headings on the site are styled with the 'Courier-New" font family. It is a rustic font that suits the aesthetic of the site and business. 
* The header also features a Hero image, which is a stock image from [pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/), that suits the colour scheme of the website.

### About Us Section 

The 'About Us' section is centered under the Hero Image on the 'Home' page. It gives a brief bit of information on the business and the services that they offer. The 'About Us' section, sits on a styled box div, that's design is based off the company's logo and its colour scheme.

### Our Bakes 

* The second page of the website features six of the most popular bakes by the Bakery. 
* Each bakes are aligned in opposite directions, per-row, along with a short descriptive paragraph in their box divs.
* The designed box divs are based off the company logo, with the RGB charcoal and orange colors, taken from the logo, using an eyedropper tool.

## Colour Scheme and Design 

The colour scheme of the website, was based off the colours that feature in the company's logo. Using [imagecolorpicker.com](https://imagecolorpicker.com), I was able to isolate and identify the RGB values for the different colours that I wanted to use for the website. See the RBG colour palette, below the company logo, created using [coolors.com](https://coolors.com).
